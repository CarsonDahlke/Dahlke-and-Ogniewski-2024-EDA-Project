###Abstract
Chickadees are a species of small songbird found across North America, including the subspecies mountain chickadees and black-capped chickadees. Each individual chickadee tends to have its own “home range” that can vary in size depending on both individual and locational factors. Due to this uncertainty, we want to explore the correlation between these chickadee subspecies (in addition to their hybridization) and their respected territory size. We will be using a “Black-capped and Mountain Chickadee Range-wide Condition” dataset which was published from the University of Colorado Boulder with data that sampled 217 chickadee individuals in northern California. We will be analyzing the variables “latitude” and “longitude” to map territories of the variable “species.” From there, we will perform an exploratory data analysis of indiduals and their territory size.  In our results, we hope to find a strong correlation between subspecies and their home range which can be used to better predict biodiversity and species distribution in ecosystems.
